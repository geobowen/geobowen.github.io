Research Experience
======
* Sept 2017 – Sept 2023:  PhD Researcher
  * Zhejiang University, School of Earth Sciences 
  * Duties includes: 
    * Collected very high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery from the Google Earth platform; created and published a COCO format dataset for the segmentation task of yardang landform
    * Implemented and improved a CNN-based deep learning model to detect, classify, and delineate yardangs and evaluated the algorithm accuracy with the change of image resolution and spatial content
    * Conducted a large-scale mapping of yardangs using the proposed deep learning model; extracted the morphological parameters (length, width, aspect ratio, orientation, area, etc.) of more than 680,000 yardangs using open-source tools and auto-process scripts to reveal their spatial distribution
    * Utilized the statistical model (PLS-SEM) to analyze the relationships between yardang abundance at the landscape scale and its impact  factors (wind, soil, topography, precipitation, etc.) derived from multi-source remote sensing and geospatial datasets
    * Constructed 3D terrain model of yardangs with Agisoft Photoscan using UAV images; modeled its near-surface wind field
    * Studied land surface erosion process in arid regions using landscape evolution modeling (Landlab)
    * Worked with team to extract other geomorphic features (dyke swarms, triangular facets) with diverse computer vision approaches
  * Supervisor: Prof. Ninghua Chen

* Jun 2021 – Jun 2022: Visiting PhD Researcher
  * Paris Lodron University of Salzburg, Department of Geoinformatics - Z_GIS
  * Duties included: 
    * Worked with the Risk, Hazard & Climate and EO Analytics research group to apply deep learning models (Mask R-CNN, Unet) to map landslides based on multispectral/SAR imagery
  * Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Thomas Blaschke

* Jan 2020 – Dec 2022: Researcher
  * China National Silk Museum
  * Duties included:
    * Worked with a team for the development of [Jinshow World Silk Interactive Map](http://jinshow.chinasilkmuseum.com/) (an information database and demonstration platform for silk cultural heritage, National Key R&D Program of China)
    * Designed data storage schema for structural and non-structural data
    * Pre-processed data, including data cleaning and spatializing with PostgreSQL and Python
    * Assisted in the paperwork for the project proposal, final report, and technical documents

* Jan 2018 – Dec 2019: Software Developer
  * Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China
  * Duties included:
    * Developed a standalone GIS application with C++ based on QGIS 2 API to manage and process raster/vector data for offshore environment research
