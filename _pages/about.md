I am a dedicated and accomplished PhD specializing in Remote Sensing and Geographic Information (GIS) from the [School of Earth Sciences](http://earth.zju.edu.cn/) at [Zhejiang University]( https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by Prof. [Ninghua Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0095108) in 2023. I also studied in the [Department of Geoinformatics – Z_GIS](https://www.plus.ac.at/geoinformatik/?lang=en) at the [University of Salzburg](https://www.plus.ac.at/?lang=en) (2021-2022) as a visiting PhD student, supervised by Prof. Dr. [Thomas Blaschke](https://www.plus.ac.at/geoinformatik/department/team/blaschke-thomas/?lang=en). My research interests lie in the fields of remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and (deep) machine learning, with a focus on developing new methods that integrate these techniques to address challenges in environmental science.

I am seeking challenging opportunities where I can apply technical expertise and research experience in solving real-world problems and developing innovative solutions for diverse fields. I am confident that being well-motivated, diligent, detail-oriented, and analytical I should be able to contribute to the future success of my employer.
